Our program tracks hundreds of celebrities' accounts on twitter, (including Musk, of course) and analyses every tweet they send in order to see whether they are talking about a Cryptocurrency or not. If they are, we run a sentiment-analysis to check if their impression is a positive or a negative one. When finished, another twitter account ( @CryptoAdvisor14 ) will send a tweet about what currency is being talked about and the mood of the twit detected.
"main code" is the main program.
